	  <h2>My Tennis Career</h2>

	  <h3>How it all started</h3>

	  <h4>I started playing tennis when covid ended. I needed to get out of the house and this was a perfect oppurtunity. When I first started playing, I was bad,really bad. I originally started playing for fun, but once it escelated, I became more serious about it. I increased my playing from about 4 hours a week to almost 15 hours a week. And that's where it all began.</h4>
