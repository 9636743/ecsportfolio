		 <h2> My Tennis Career</h2> </div>

	  <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;How it all started</h3>

	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I started playing tennis when covid ended. I needed to get out of the house and this was a perfect oppurtunity. When I first started playing, I was bad, really bad. I &nbsp;&nbsp;originally started playing for fun, but once it escelated, I became more serious about it. I increased my playing from about 4 hours a week to almost 15 hours a week. &nbsp;&nbsp;And that's where it all began.</p>

	  <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern Day Playing</h3>

	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since I started playing more, I got good. Not amazing, but good. My modern day schedule goes like this: </p>
		  <ul> 
			  <li>Playing every fay for about 2-2.5 hours </li>  
		  <li>Playing tournaments around once a month</li>
			  <li>Playing high school tennis matches starting in March</li>
		  
		  </ul>
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;My tennis playing schdule is what has made me become the player I have become today. Without all of this, I probably would not be as good as I am today.  </p>

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I Play/Who I Play With</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My tennis career started at The Sports Mall, an amazing tennis facility in Murray, UT. </p>
